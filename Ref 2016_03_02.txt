	Hectic Traffic on the way for an interesting Start for the Day (Forget that -Done)
	
	We will be working on our Websites this morning until taking an Exam on everything we have learned so far.
	
	Worked on building tables and adding to my personal Website.
	
	Practiced improving my Google Searches.
	
	Took the Exam and realized I need more practice writing HTML (Hand Writing out my code will help me improve my skills and knowledge)
