Day 6 DevCodeCamp

 Monday Week 2 Day 1
 
		Turned in short Story with functions and classes ( Needs Work)
		
		Covered Loops in Java
			For Loops -can be used when a known end point
			For Each Loops -can be used across arrays
			
			While Loops - Looping while Condition is TRUE.	
					    - Breakout of Loop when NOT True
						
			DO NOT USE doWhile Loops !!!
			
			
			Java Inheritance vs Extends keyword
				- Inheritance; process where one Class acquires fields and methods of another classes
				- Subclass(derived class, child class) inherits properties from the SuperClass (base class, parent class)
				
			EXTENDS Key Word
				- Use the 'Extends' keyword to inherit the properties of a class
				Example-
				
				public class Animal{
				}
				public class Dog extends Animal{
				}
				
				
			- Constructor
				- A subclass inherits all the members (fields and methods) from its superclass
				-Constructors are not members, the are not inherited by subclasses
				- Constructor from a Superclass can be Invoked from the Subclass
				
			- Super Keyword
				- Used to diferntiate members of superclass from members of subclass if they have the same names
				- Super keyword used to invoke the superclass constructor from the subclass
				- Super() calss the parent constructor with no arguments
				
			Worked on Fizzbuzz project
			Worked on Robots Project
