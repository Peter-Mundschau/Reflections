Day 4 DevCodeCamp

Polished up some Html and CSS on  Personal Website

Started Working with JAVA (Whole new Experience)
	Variables in JAVA;	
		- Variables are named (assigned space) in Memory - RAM
		- Data assigned to a variable can be called upon later
		- Variables should be descriptive Nouns (Good Descriptive Names)
		- Case Sensitive
		- Must start with a letter and can contain numbers and letters and some special characters.
		- Best practice to declare variables before assigning values to them
		
		- Reserved Words that CAN'T be used as variables or identifiers
			- assert break class continue case do else enum extends for if import new
			private public protected return static super switch this
			
			
		- Operators (Order of Operations is important)
			+ - * / % = modulus(returns remainder) 
			++  increment
			--  decrement
			
		- Assignment Operators
			=  +=  -=  *=  /=  %=  
			
		- Comparison Operators
			==  !=  >  <  >=  <=
			
		- Data Types (8)
			int myNumber = 88;	// 32 bit number
			short myShort = 847; // 16 bit number
			long myLong = 9898;  // 64 bit value
			double myDouble = 7.3243;
			float myFloat = 324.3f;
			char myChar = 'y';
			boolean myBoolean = "true" != null;
			byte myByte	=127
			
		- Number Types
			int Price;		float Number;		long Cost;		double someVar;	
			
		- Strings - Strings are immutable in JAVA
		
		- Boolean - True or False
		
		
		
		
		- FLOW CONTROL
			- if
			- else if / else
			- switch case  ( Used to check for a Single Variable (Like User Input))
				- must have a default ( if there is NO case Match)
				- Only ONE case is executed "break;" must be used at the end of each case
