Day 9 DevCodeCamp

Thursday Week 2 Day 4
	- Finished as much as possible on Dice game during the morning before due time 10:00am.
	
	- Adam shared how he would create a game similar in nature to ours.
		- Very informative but when it starts running into areas such as function calls that I have no familarity with it becomes a little more difficult for me.  To me the object API's don't seem obvious in JAVA to me.
		
		Worked on Happy #'s and Nim game.
