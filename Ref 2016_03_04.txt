Day 5 DevCodeCamp

JAVA DAY 2
		
	- Functions
		= small reusable pieces of code that should do only one task and be about 5 lines of code.  ( More than 5 Lines or 2 Functions/ Split into another Function)
		
	- Functions have a signature, accessibility level, return type, functions name and paramaters
	
		-Only the Signature is visible to the Outside World
		-Parameters provide "outside" data to the function
		-The Functions 'code block' is what is executed when the function is called
		-'return' sends the result to the Caller
	
	- Void Functions
		- functions that does not have to return a result
		
	-OBJECTS in JAVA 
		- Much like the Real World 'objects' have properties
			-properties describe the object - color, contents
			-properties are also methods or what the object can do
			
		- Member Variables
			- describe the object and keep track of attributes
			
		- Member Functions 
			- give the object functionality
			
		- Constructors
			- run anytime a new instance of a class is created
			
		- Instantiation
			- Create an Instance using of a function by using 'new' functionName
			
		- Dot (.) notation
			- to access member variables and functions
				door.Open();
				
		
	Worked on new JAVA assignments.
